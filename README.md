# Bankruptcy Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting bankruptcy. The model is trained on historical financial data and uses various algorithms and techniques to classify whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy or not.

## Introduction

This machine learning model predicts the likelihood of bankruptcy by analyzing historical financial data. It helps identify companies facing financial distress or at risk of going bankrupt.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. You can obtain the dataset from [source link] and follow the provided instructions to preprocess the data.

## Data Cleaning

Thorough data cleaning procedures were performed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.

## Data Exploration

An in-depth analysis of the dataset was conducted, including descriptive statistics and visualizations, to gain insights into its characteristics and understand the distribution of bankruptcy instances.

## Missing Values

Missing values in the dataset were addressed, resulting in a cleaned dataset with reduced missing entries.

## Dealing with Outliers

Outliers were analyzed, and it was observed that removing them might negatively impact the model. Therefore, the outliers were not dealt with, and their impact on the model's performance was evaluated.

## Correlation Check

A correlation matrix was examined, highlighting strong linear relationships between financial ratios and growth rates. These correlations provide insights into a company's financial health and performance.

## Installation and Usage

Refer to the provided instructions in the repository to set up the environment, install dependencies, and utilize the bankruptcy prediction model.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
